# PRIMM: Classes

## PRIMM
PRIMM is a Computer Science instructional strategy that is driven around inquiry-based exploration. You start off by looking at existing code and investigating what it does to modifying the code to extend its functionality to idependently creating something new using what you learned.

At first, I will ask you to hold to the PRIMM process. We won't use the strategy for every new concept, and as we move along, you will be able to move more quickly through it.

You will follow the instructions and enter your answers in the REFLECTIONS.md file.
