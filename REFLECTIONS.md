## Predict
**Without running the program**, predict what its behavior is.

1. What will the program output when it is run?
    >  your answer
2. What do you think the words `public` and `private` mean?
    >  your answer
3. How are the files `ShapeDriver.java` and `Square.java` related? 
    >  your answer
4. There is no method definition for `Square()`. Do you think the code will compile? 
    > your answer
5. Why do the methods/functions `getSide()` and `setSide()` exist? 
    > your answer

## Run
Run the program. 
1. What is the output?
    > your answer

2. Did your prediction agree with the output? Explain where it may have differed.
    > your answer

## Investigate
In this section, your instructor will alternate between explaining topics and tackling a `TODO` in the Modify section.
Make sure you take careful notes on the major topics.

## Modify
Starting with the `Square.java` file, resolve each of the `TODO` items. 
Once you have resolved a `TODO`, make sure to remove the text `TODO` so it doesn't 
appear on the list.


## Make
Implement a brand new shape of your choice. It should store the major data for that shape and make
setter and getter method available along with a constructor that is appropriate.
Ensure you instantiate the class in the driver's `main()` method and print out the data attributes.
